            'Emma started the interiors side of the business over 15 years ago. A passion for houses inherited from her property developing mother, Emmaâ€™s earliest memories were of accompanying her to fabric houses and reclamation yards. "I loved watching the transformation of a run down house into a warm, light-filled home. I found it magical. The excitement of that process and the desire to bring out the best of a house remains at the heart of everything we do at Emma Kirby Design."'
